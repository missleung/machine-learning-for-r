```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load all libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Importing data set
```{r}
dat_Raw <- read_csv("BlackFriday.csv")

head(dat_Raw) # take a look at what's inside this csv file
colnames(dat_Raw) # what variables?
```

## Let's briefly take a look at some plots
```{r}
ggplot(dat_Raw)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
