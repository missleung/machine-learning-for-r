```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load all libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
```
## Purpose

We will conduct random forest to predict the number of purchase made

```{r}
dat_User <- read_csv("BlackFriday-User.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
